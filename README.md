# QBertAndroidGame
An android game app inspired by Q*Bert - This app includes two parts:
  1. A Kotlin Android Studio Jetpack Compose app part for the main screen, login and create account page and functionality, and statistics/leaderboard screen and viewing. This part also includes the start button to launch the Unity game using intents.
  2. The actual Unity app/game that you can play.

To run the full app on your own machine, you need to build both separately.
